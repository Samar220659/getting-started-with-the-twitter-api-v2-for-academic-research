  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  state TEXT NOT NULL,
  zip_code TEXT,
  max_results INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'

  source TEXT DEFAULT 'hunter',
  confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Third-Party Integrations Required

### Export Button Theory Implementation

This application perfectly demonstrates Greg Isenberg's Export Button Theory:

1. **Manual Pain Point Identified**: Copying business data from Google Maps manually
2. **Workflow Breakdown**: Users export/copy data to use elsewhere (spreadsheets, CRMs)
3. **AI Automation Solution**: Automated scraping + intelligent email discovery
4. **Immediate Value**: 30-second automation vs. hours of manual work
5. **Monetization Ready**: $10-30K/month potential per the theory

### Business Model Suggestions
- **Pay-per-search**: $1-5 per search (includes up to 50 results)
- **Monthly subscriptions**: $29/month (100 searches), $99/month (unlimited)
- **Agency plan**: $299/month (white-label + team features)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for high-volume users

The application is production-ready for frontend deployment and needs only backend integration to become a fully functional SaaS business following Greg Isenberg's proven framework.
